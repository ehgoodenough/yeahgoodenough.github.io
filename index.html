                Or rather, to encourage everyone to make something that is <b>"good enough."</b> It doesn't have
                to be perfectly optimized or perfectly designed. It doesn't have to meet all the expectations we
                had when we first dreamed up the idea. It just has to work, even if the prototype is quick and dirty
                and hacky; that prototype is worth so much more than the idea that only lives in our head.
